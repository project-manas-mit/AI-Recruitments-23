Hi. Here are a few examples to help you visualize the input format for the Malpe Mayhem challenge.

You can see a "test_case_0.gif" file, which is a visualization of the sample input that you see on the HackerRank challenge page.

Apart from that, there are two more examples. You can find the input 3D arrays in txt files. And the corresponding GIFs have the visual representations of the same.

Dino Tim wishes you all the best!
